===============

Third-party whole applications. These are bigger pieces that can be depended upon, but are generally considered standalone.

E.g., [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), [Firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl), [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) [soon!].
