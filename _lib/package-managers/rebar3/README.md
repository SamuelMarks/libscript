# Rebar3

Bootstrap module for the `rebar3` package manager.

## Usage

Ensures the `rebar3` executable is available. This relies on the core language toolchain appropriate
for the tool.

## Architecture

`libscript` manages `rebar3` versions natively by default
(`REBAR3_INSTALL_METHOD=libscript_native`), ensuring isolated installations without polluting global
system paths. You can override this to use `system`, `mise`, `asdf`, `pkgx`, or `vfox` if preferred.

Libscript manages rebar3 versions natively by installing them into isolated directories under
`LIBSCRIPT_HOME/rebar3/<version>`.

## Version Management

As outlined in the core philosophy, `libscript` manages the versions natively. Installations are
isolated by default in `~/.libscript/<component>/<version>` and do not pollute global system paths.
