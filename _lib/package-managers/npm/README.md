# Npm

for the tool.

## Architecture

`libscript` manages `npm` versions natively by default (`NPM_INSTALL_METHOD=libscript_native`),
ensuring isolated installations without polluting global system paths. You can override this to use
`system`, `mise`, `asdf`, `pkgx`, or `vfox` if preferred.

Libscript manages npm versions natively by installing them into isolated directories under
`LIBSCRIPT_HOME/npm/<version>`.

## Version Management

As outlined in the core philosophy, `libscript` manages the versions natively. Installations are
isolated by default in `~/.libscript/<component>/<version>` and do not pollute global system paths.
